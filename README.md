# Gym Website - Personal Project

I wanted to create a gym website as a personal projet as the websites I currently navigate for my gym and iceskating classes are hard to use and I felt like they needed improvement. This sparked the idea for my personal project. I started off following a tutorial on YouTube to get my basic template down. Since then I have altered many elements to my website. I have inserted photos and added effects for buttons to change colour on hover. The majority of my project is unfinished as I've just got started with the CSS and HTML. I'm going to move onto the JavaScript next to get my page to a fully functioning and user friendly page. There's a lot of features I want to add including a form to contact us, a way for them to sign up to a membership and a page for them to view all our machines and services. I'd also like to impliment geolocation so users can use their current location to search for gyms near them which will be my most challenging task.
